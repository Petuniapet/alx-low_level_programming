Python dictionaries are elegantly implemented using hash tables. Upon completion of this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of the robustness and simplicity underlying Python dictionaries. Despite the apparent simplicity of expressions like d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, a multitude of operations are occurring behind the scenes. It's important to note that the Python interpreter doesn't employ the exact implementation you will be working on today. For those intrigued by the inner workings, there is an informative blog post detailing how dictionaries were implemented in Python 2.7.
